# Climate-Wins-Weather-Supervised-ML-Predictions
The following project took weather data collected from 18 weather stations located across Europe every day over the past 60+ years. Weather variables such as temperature, wind, precipitation, etc. were the measurements used to determine if a single day contained pleasant or unpleasant weather. The Python scripts detail how this collected data was scaled, optimized, and used in predictive machine learning models such as the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods. Using these models, we wanted to predict future weather events and the effects of climate change over time.
